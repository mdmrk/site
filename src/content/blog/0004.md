Finally, a new post after 3 months, been busy... Today I will be using `scrot` for screen grabbing inside dwm. For this to work I'll be using a helper macro that spawns a shell command, which should already be inside your `config.h` file. There is another work around to this that will be explained at the end.

## Method 1

Find or create the macro inside `config.h`.
```c
#define SHCMD(cmd) { .v = (const char*[]){ "/bin/sh", "-c", cmd, NULL } }
```

Define your screenshot command, in my case I'll name it `SSCMD`.
```c
#define SSCMD "scrot -s -l mode=edge -e 'xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i $f' /home/{USER}/Pictures/screenshots/screenshot_%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S.png"
```

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scrot` | Screen capture utility |
| `-s` | Select area to capture |
| `-l mode=edge` | Highlight selection edges |
| `-e '...'` | Run command after capture |
| `xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i $f` | Copy screenshot to clipboard |
| `/home/{USER}/Pictures/screenshots/screenshot_%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S.png` | Save path with timestamp filename |


Finnaly add a new keybinding.
```c 
static const Key keys[] = {
    // ...
    { MODKEY|ShiftMask,         XK_s,           spawn,          SHCMD(SSCMD) },
    // ...
}
```

If you find some trouble you can try adding a small delay just like this:

```c
#define SSCMD "sleep 0.2; scrot ..."
```
## Method 2

Apply the [keypressrelease patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/keypressrelease/).
